##Step 1 - Forking

The first thing you want to do is **fork** from a repository that you want to work on. This creates a copy of the repository under your user, and allows you to make changes without affecting the original repo.

To do this for the [Digital Methods Group](https://github.com/Ekori/digital-methods-group), you can click on the **fork** button in the top right-hand corner of the page. ![alt text](https://github.com/Ekori/digital-methods-group/blob/master/_images/Fork.png?raw=true "Fork")

##Step 2 - Making changes

After clicking the fork button, you'll notice that you are taken to a copy of the repository, but this time it is under your username. In the corner top left corner of the page, you'll see something like this:

You are now safe to make changes without affecting the original repository.

Let's say you want to make some changes to the **README.md** file. First, click on the name of the file. If you are opening a Markdown (.md) file, you will see a page that looks something like this:

![alt text](https://github.com/Ekori/digital-methods-group/blob/master/_images/Test_page.png?raw=true "File view")

You have several view options in *page view* toolbar including **Raw** and **History**.

You can choose to view the file in your desktop application (if installed), to edit te file or to bin it. If you choose to edit the file, you will be presented with a plain-text version of the file, ready for changes: 

![alt text](https://github.com/Ekori/digital-methods-group/blob/master/_images/Edit.png?raw=true "File view") 

Make your changes: 

![alt text](https://github.com/Ekori/digital-methods-group/blob/master/_images/Edit2.png?raw=true "File view") 

To save your changes, you can scroll to the bottom to **commit changes** to the file.

![alt text](https://github.com/Ekori/digital-methods-group/blob/master/_images/Commit.png?raw=true "File view") 

You will get a default suggestion for labelling the commit (this label describes the changes you've made). You can edit this to add something a bit more descriptive.
