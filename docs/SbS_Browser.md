#Step by step - Using the GitHub Website

This is a guide written specifically for interacting with the **Digital Methods Group GitHub**. If you would like a general introduction, there are plenty of great guides out there for getting to grips with Git and GitHub (you can find some links [here](/Getting_started.md)). 

This guide assumes that you **already have a GitHub account**, but you **don't have to have Git or the client installed on your machine**. 

Because we assume that several members of the group will be limited by what they can install on the University PCs, we have tried to create a workflow for uploading your content to the account using just the browser. This does have limitations, so if you would like to be more involved in the running of the page, you can either use your own machine or ask IT to install the client for you.


##Step 1 - Forking

The first thing you want to do is **fork** from a repository that you want to work on. This creates a copy of the repository under your user, and allows you to make changes without affecting the original repo.

To do this for the [Digital Methods Group](https://github.com/Ekori/digital-methods-group), you can click on the **fork** button in the top right-hand corner of the page. ![alt text](https://github.com/Ekori/digital-methods-group/blob/master/_images/Fork.png?raw=true "Fork")

##Step 2 - Making changes

After clicking the fork button, you'll notice that you are taken to a copy of the repository, but this time it is under your username. In the corner top left corner of the page, you'll see something like this:

You are now safe to make changes without affecting the original repository.

Let's say you want to make some changes to the **README.md** file. First, click on the name of the file. If you are opening a Markdown (.md) file, you will see a page that looks something like this:

![alt text](https://github.com/Ekori/digital-methods-group/blob/master/_images/Test_page.png?raw=true "File view")

You have several view options in *page view* toolbar including **Raw** and **History**.

You can choose to view the file in your desktop application (if installed), to edit te file or to bin it. If you choose to edit the file, you will be presented with a plain-text version of the file, ready for changes:

Make your changes:

To save your changes, you can scroll to the bottom to **commit changes** to the file.

![alt text](https://github.com/Ekori/digital-methods-group/blob/master/_images/Commit.png?raw=true "File view") 

You will get a default suggestion for labelling the commit (this label describes the changes you've made). You can edit this to add something a bit more descriptive.

Once your pull request (commit) has been sent to the **main user**, they will receive a request to approve your pull request:
