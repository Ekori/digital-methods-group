#####Attending: Stuart, Elina

Actions carried out on the group site:
* Elina removed circle formatting from the group logo avatar (and it was awesome).
* Stuart created a passably adequate group logo that will serve as a placeholder until something more adequate can be created.
* Elina changed the site header image.

Actions to be carried out for the next meeting:
* Elina to pin title bar, add overlay (group name and down arrow?) to header image, and create group timeline (including word cloud).
* Stuart to compose email for distribution to advertise/canvass for group participants. 

The date of the next meeting is t.b.c..
